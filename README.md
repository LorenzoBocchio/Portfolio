# **Projects**

### [Sentiment and Semantics: Applying NLP to Uncover Media Framing Techniques in Environmental News (May 2023)](Projects/sentiment_n_semantic.md)
Finding differences between the framing of environmental news in conservative media versus liberal media by employing NLP techniques.

### **Timing of peridural catheter removal in the mother with risk factors for post-partum complications and without risk factors (November 2022)**
Statistical Consultancy for Dr. Setti and Dr. Menko. Comparing the distributions of complications in ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia parturients divided by risk factors.

### [Application of Hidden Markov Models to Longitudinal Data (November 2022)](Projects/hmm.md)
Focused on the theoretical application of HMMs to longitudinal data, applying parameters' pooling and discrete or continuous random effects.

### [Clustering tweets with Vectorization algorithms using Python (February 2022)](Projects/covid_tweet_clustering.md)
Testing various clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, BIRCH, Hierarchical Agglomerative) on almost a million tweets. Applied TF-IDF and CountVectorizer to convert data from a raw format into vectors of real numbers.

### **Identification of clusters with Projection Pursuit-based methods (Bachelor Thesis, September 2021)**
The objective was using PCA and projection pursuit to cluster a dataset with high dimensionality, composed of 8221 variables measured on 34 subjects. In order to overcome the absence of gaussianity, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the distribution of subpopulations.

### **Dissecting Comedy: Sentiment Analysis, Classification and Topic Modelling of Text Data using R (June 2021)**
Scraped and analyzed 228 Comedy Specials' scripts. Built a metric based on obscene language for classification and performed topic modeling for clustering.
