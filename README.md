# Projects

##[Sentiment and Semantics: Applying NLP to Uncover Media Framing Techniques in Environmental News (May 2023)](Projects/sentiment_n_semantic.md)

Trying to find differences between the framing of environmental news in conservative media versus liberal media.

## Timing of peridural catheter removal in the mother with risk factors for post-partum complications and without risk factors (November 2022)
Statistical Consultancy for Dr. Setti and Dr. Menko. Comparing the distributions of complications in ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia parturients divided by risk factors.

## Application of Hidden Markov Models to Longitudinal Data (November 2022)
For the Advanced Statistical Learning course. Focused on the theoretical application of HMMs to longitudinal data, applying parameters' pooling and discrete or continuous random effects.

## Clustering tweets with Vectorization algorithms using Python (February 2022)
For the Machine Learning Systems For Data Science exam. Tested different clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, BIRCH, Hierarchical Agglomerative) on almost a million tweets. Applied TF-IDF and CountVectorizer to convert data from a raw format into vectors of real numbers.

## Identification of clusters with Projection Pursuit-based methods (Bachelor Thesis, September 2021)
The objective was using PCA and projection pursuit to cluster a dataset with high dimensionality, composed of 8221 variables measured on 34 subjects. In order to overcome the absence of gaussianity, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the distribution of subpopulations.

## Dissecting Comedy: Sentiment Analysis, Classification and Topic Modelling of Text Data using R (June 2021)
Scraped and analyzed 228 Comedy Specials' scripts for the Statistical Methods for Data Science exam. Built a metric based on obscene language for classification and performed topic modeling for clustering.
